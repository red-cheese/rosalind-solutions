Lessons learned:

* REAR - reversal distance: NP-hard for unsigned permutations (polynomial for signed). Lots of approximations.
Can do DFS inside an approximating greedy approach.
IDDFS didn't work - maybe precomputing paths with length up to 5 would help.

* Catalan numbers

* KMP - Knuth-Morris-Pratt (borders).
